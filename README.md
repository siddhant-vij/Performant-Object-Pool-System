# Performant Object Pool System

Design and implement a robust, generic, and performant object pool system in Java to manage the lifecycle of expensive-to-create objects such as database connections, network connections, or any other resource-intensive objects.

## Key Features

- **Generics**: Ensure the object pool system is generic to handle different types of objects.
- **Concurrency Control**: Implement thread-safety for concurrent access to the pool.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Utilize a BlockingQueue as it is most suitable for managing the pool while ensuring thread-safety.
- **Object Lifecycle Management**: Incorporate object creation, validation, and destruction mechanisms via an Object Factory.
- **Error Handling**: Develop advanced error handling for scenarios like failed object creation or validation.


## Performant Features

- **Object Preloading**: Preload a specified number of objects during the initialization of the pool.
- **Dynamic Size Management**: Allow the pool to dynamically adjust its size based on demand.
- **Lazy Initialization**: Create objects only when they are needed.
- **Bulk Borrowing and Returning**: Allow borrowing and returning of multiple objects at once.
- **Asynchronous Object Operations**: Offload object creation & destruction to asynchronous code.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced Monitoring**: Implement advanced monitoring capabilities to provide real-time insights into the pool's performance and health.
- **Optimized Validation**: Research and implement optimized validation strategies to reduce the overhead of object validation.
- **Object Expiration**: Implement object expiration to periodically remove and recreate objects that have been in the pool for a prolonged period.
- **Enhanced Recovery**: Build enhanced error recovery mechanisms to handle different failure scenarios gracefully.
- **Enhanced Concurrency**: Explore more efficient concurrency control mechanisms to reduce contention and improve throughput.
- **Pool Partitioning**: Partition the object pool by allowing multiple threads to access different partitions of the pool simultaneously.
- **Configuration Options**: Provide configuration options to tune the behavior of the pool, such as the max. pool size, validation, and eviction policies.
- **Performance Testing**: Conduct thorough performance testing under different scenarios to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
- **Database Enhancements**: For DB connection pooling, implement connection validation & recovery mechanisms to handle database failovers efficiently.
- **Network Enhancements**: For network connection pooling, implement connection retry & backoff mechanisms to handle network failures gracefully.
